application.view.FrontEndFXMain.java

This is where it starts. Run this and that's it....

Not all is complete. There are still a few unfinished items.
Default project not working correctly (The menu items are not changing correctly)
The scheduled dates completion dates on the task has a few missing features.
Unit testing I have run out of time to update my tests from the originals. Everything is very different now.
Anyway... that's it I've run out of time, was expecting to do more, but this will have to do.
